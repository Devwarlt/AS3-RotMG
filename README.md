# AS3-RotMG
Hacked together sources for a variety of RotMG clients

CrazyClient: Added new petyard and other features but did a very sloppy job

LazyClient: Completely re-started but maintained similar functionality. The current version is very incomplete

Vanilla: Started from a fresh x27.0.1 client and only fixed a few visual bugs
